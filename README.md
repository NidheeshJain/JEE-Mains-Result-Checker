# jeemainresultchecker
This small tool retrieves the JEE-Mains result data and saves you from any hassles of clicks and all.
Since this is Open-Source you can also port it to check results of other exams or retrieve data from a website by some pre-defined macro actions. It would be Great if you leave the Credits in the software as it is :-)

Requirements:<br />
A working Internet Connection.<br />
A Windows PC.

How To Check the result by standalone app:
1. Download and run "JEE Main Result Checker.exe".
2. Enter your Details.
3. Enter the captcha.(it may take small amount of time to load)
4. Click on "Show Result" button.
5. Wait for Few seconds.
6. A MessageBox will appear containing your name, your overall as well as Subjectwise Percentiles.
7. Click OK to dismiss the MessageBox

8. Repeat from Step2 if you want to search results of more Roll Numbers.


and yes it would be awesome if someone figures out and implement a good captcha solving engine in the code so that......you know what I mean!!!!
